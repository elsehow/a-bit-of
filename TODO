QUESTIONS:

- every time i reload a file, it does it twice. why?

- if i reference some module from my script, and change that, it won't update.... what's a way around that?
  * hard reload button?

- how come NOTHING hot-reloads when i run my script from sketchbook? weird..

- how would i test this thing?
  - how would i see what update functions were doing?
  - how could i make sure that the right stuff was going to the right places?




NOTES

- everything has stream inputs + outputs... except setup()
  this caused a bug, just because it broke a rhythm/ pattern
  maybe each is different, who knows.


- what if this were just arbitrary arrangements
  of producer -> transform -> consumer
  tied together by kefir
  consumer()s got executed in a browser/node environment.
  would be cool, but KISS for now


- what if only the transformer hot-reloaded?
  seems reasonable, no?
