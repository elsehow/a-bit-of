refactor tests
- test.utils
dream about integration tests
- test 1 configuration - simple 3-layer
- test another - multiple streams passing between the layers

imagine more complex graphs,,,

rethink erroring and validation
- should validate *all* user input 
- but how do errors occur, mechanically?

refactor
- private/public methods
