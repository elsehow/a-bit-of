refactor tests
- some specs are for component.
- function to make a spy endpoint would be good.
- some tests can be collapsed
component test
- with new mechanisms won't take long
dream about integration tests
- test 1 configuration - simple 3-layer
- test another - multiple streams passing between the layers
imagine more complex graphs,,,
